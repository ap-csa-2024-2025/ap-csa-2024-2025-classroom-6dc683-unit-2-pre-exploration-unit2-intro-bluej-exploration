# unit2-intro-bluej-exploration

## Warm Up
In the `WarmUp.java` file, create two methods
* One method named `isEven` that takes in an integer, and returns `true` if it is even, and `false` otherwise
* One method named `isDivisble` that takes in two integers - say `a` and `b` - and returns `true` if `a` can be divided by `b`, and `false` otherwise

## Exploration Instructions
Clone this repository, and put it somewhere nice (like the Desktop or in Documents) so that you have the BlueJ and Java files.  You will be using the BlueJ application to do this exploration.  There is nothing you need to modify, commit, or turn in for this activity.

Complete the exploration found in the [Unit 2 Intro - BlueJ Exploration Slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGRpKcj4qc/ngji0fbRjriexuydDm5S-w/view?utm_content=DAGRpKcj4qc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)
